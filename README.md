# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
Developed by:D.R.Vinuthna
RegisterNumber:21005742 
*/

```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",a**b)

## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](https://github.com/VINUTHNA-2004/EXPONENTIATION/blob/main/Screenshot%20(40).png?raw=true)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
